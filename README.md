# PCR Machine (Thermocycler)
This project is currently in progress. Right now, I am working on the Software end of things, so check out the inc/ and src/ folders. CAD/ and Hardware/ folders are currently empty

# Project Goals
Develope a low-cost, high performance PCR machine for use in research labs

# Problem to Be Solved
Current options for laboratory grade PCR machines are in the thousands of dollars. After fixing a couple of these machines for a microbiology lab that my father runs, I realized that the components that they were built off of were relatively simple and inexpensive. This gave me the idea to create my own PCR machine so that labs can stop being forced to spend thousands in grant funding on machines that could be made for only a couple hundred.
